# Envault

Envault is a Sublime Text package that wraps the
[Envault Service](https://github.com/axel669/envault) by
[@axel669](https://github.com/axel669).

Envault is a service that replaces `.env` files in your projects in favor of a
`YAML` configuration file that serves the same purpose and:

- Can be checked into source control (without leaking secrets!) allowing you to
  spin up fully configured development environments and deployments easily.
- Allows you to share a common set of variable values, with a single change
  propagating to all projects without any extra work.

This particular package is a Sublime Text wrapper around the Envault service,
allowing you to seamlessly use Envault in your Sublime projects with no extra
tooling required.

This package requires, at minimum, Sublime Text version 4095.
