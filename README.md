# Envault

This is where the README information for the package goes, which is shown to
people on GitHub and is referenced from the Package Control website for the
package.

There should be a brief description here, as well as possibly some screenshots
where appropriate. Screenshots should be stored in `docs/images` so that the
link can reference them (in fact, before we go production, make a fake one and
add it).

The screenshots can be elided from the documentation if needed by telling
`mkdocs` what files in the `docs` folder it should not handle. There is no
example of that currently (but, you know, add one when you do the thing above).

This package requires, at minimum, Sublime Text version 4180

TODO:
    - sandbox page with common stuff we will want like the admonition list and
      the like.
    - Ensure all pages are decent stubs, unlike what they are right now
        - this includes verifying the social icons as well
