title: Open the current Envault Config
description: Command to Open the current Envault configuration file
---

This command will open the currently active configuration file for this window
so that you can view or edit it. Although you can do this manually, this can be
a handy way to get at the exact file you need quicker, if there is more than one
configuration file available in the window.

Saves to the currently active configuration file will cause the file to be
automaticall re-loaded as if you used the [Reload Config](reload_config.md)
command.
