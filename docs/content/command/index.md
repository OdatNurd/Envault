title: Envault Commands
description: Controlling and using Envault
---

Envault comes with a selection of commands that allow you to create, activate,
edit and query [configuration files](../usage/config_format.md) for your
projects.

All of the commands outlined here are available from the `Command Palette` with
an `Envault:` prefix. You can open the command palette with ++ctrl+shift+p++ on
Windows and Linux or ++cmd+shift+p++ on MacOS.

Commands generally hide themselves from the command palette if they do not apply
in the current window, although not all do (for example,
[Envault: Choose Active Config](choose_config.md), is always available).
