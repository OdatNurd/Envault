# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Envault?

[Envault](https://github.com/axel669/envault) is a service envisioned by fellow
developer and Twitch Streamer [@axel669](https://github.com/axel669) to make it
easier to set up and use `environment variables` to configure applications and
tooling, both during development and also during deployment.

## Is it available yet?

As of the time of this writing, no; it is still being worked on. However, it is
possible to run a version of the service yourself if desired.
