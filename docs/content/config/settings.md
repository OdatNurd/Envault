## Opening Settings

You would go to `Preferences > Settings > Envault` and choose the
settings
item; then they would appear here.

Remind people that the default settings on the left are applied; copy any you
would like to change into the right hand pane and modify their value.

!!! warning

    remember the alamo (and that JSON is a thing). Key the items as a key/value
    pair list, with commas in between. Your custom file should be structured
    the same as the one on the left (but with potentially fewer settings in it).
