description: Customizing your Envault installation
---

The `Envault` package has a suite of configuration options that you can use to
customize various aspects of its features, allowing you to customize things to
your workflow and preference/requirements.

The configuration options have been set to values that should be ready to go
right out of the box for most users, so little to no configuration should be
required to get things up and running.

For further customization, you may want to adjust some of the package
[settings](settings.md) to suit your needs.
