## Opening Settings

You would go to `Preferences > Settings > Envault` and choose the
keybind item; then they would appear here.

Remind people that the default key bindings on the left are applied; copy any
you would like to change into the right hand pane and modify their value.

!!! warning

    remember the Alamo (and that JSON is a thing). Key the items as a key/value
    pair list, with commas in between. Your custom file should be structured
    the same as the one on the left (but with potentially fewer things in it).

!!! warning

    actually now that I think about it, the default keys in the left are
    probably commented out so that they don't apply by default unless you want
    them to.

    So, you probably want to copy the keys that you actually want, uncomment
    them, and then adjust them as needed.
